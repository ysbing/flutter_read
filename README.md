## Installation

1. Add this package to your Flutter project's `pubspec.yaml` file according to the installation instructions

   ```

2. Import the necessary libraries

   import 'package:flutter_read/flutter_read.dart';
   ```

## Usage

1. Declare a novel controller variable:
   ```dart
   final ReadController readController = ReadController.create();
   ```

2. Add the novel widget to the interface:
   ```dart
   @override            
   Widget build(BuildContext context) {
     return MaterialApp(
       home: ReadView(readController: readController),
     );
   }
   ```

3. Open the novel:
   ```dart
   final ByteData byteData = await rootBundle.load("assets/斗罗大陆.txt");
   BookSource source = ByteDataSource(byteData, "《斗罗大陆》", isSplit: true);
   int state = await readController.startReadBook(source);
   ```

4. Listen to the novel reading progress:
   ```dart
   StreamSubscription subscription =
   readController.onPageIndexChanged.listen((progress) {
     // Handle logic for page index changes
   });
   
   // Unsubscribe when the page exits
   @override
   void dispose() {
     subscription.cancel();
     super.dispose();
   }
   ```
